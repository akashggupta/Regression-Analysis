# This is the simple project on multi-variable regression 
In this project I have investigated 'mtcars' data set which consist of 32 observation and 11 variable like(mpg,qsec,am,etc) 
In this project I have taken 'mpg' as as outcome variable and tried to find the best model which consist of different regressors and their 
interaction.
For model selection  I have used forward and backward stepwise selection technique and anova method to find the best fit model which has as 
max as possible R-squared value because the larger the R-squared value of a model the larger variance it can explaine that is the main thing
we want in our model
